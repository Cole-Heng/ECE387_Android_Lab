# ECE387_Android_Lab
Lab assignment for ECE387 to create an Android app

This app has a button that displays a message when you press it.

The important files used to edit the app can be found in 
<br>`app/src/main/java/com/example/ece387_android_lab/MainActivity.java`
<br>and
<br>`app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`


A video showing the app running on my phone can be found here:
